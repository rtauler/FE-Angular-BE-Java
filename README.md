# Energy Tools Hiring exercise

* The frontend/ project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.
* The backend was generated by [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)

## Working on the backend

We use IntelliJ Idea Community, but feel free to use any other tool. After you modify the source code, kill any running app and run with
`./mvnw spring-boot:run`. (you probably need [maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) installed)

## Working on the frontend

* You need a recent node/npm
* cd to frontend/ and run `npm install`
* Run `npm run start` (which will run "ng serve") for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. This should be enough for you to work on the frontend and for us to check the results.

## Tasks

1. Make the multiRequestComponent make 3 consecutive requests, 100ms apart.
2. Each request should have an HTTP header `X-Request-Type` with value 'A', 'B', and 'C', in order.
3. The API makes requests of type A wait a bit to simulate some computation.
4. Modify the backend to guarantee that request A gets counter 1 in spite of the delay; B gets 2 and C gets 3. Keep it simple.
5. Show a spinner ("loading indicator") in the frontend while the 3 requests are pending. When all are complete, show the results.
Think _promises/observables_, not a counter like `pending--` ;)
6. Show 3 boxes with the value obtained by request A, B and C in order.
It should be 1-2-3 on the first execution, 4-5-6 on the second, etc.
7. Add a refresh button so you can trigger the 3 requests again instead of reloading the page.
8. Add a milliseconds timer that increases while the spinner is showing (maybe 3-5ms step?),
and stays fixed after that to show how long it took to get the 3 results.
9. Make the component a little nice showing off your mad CSS skills =)
