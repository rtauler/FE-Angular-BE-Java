# Energy Tools Hiring exercise

* The frontend/ project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.
* The backend was generated by [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)

## Tasks

1. Make the multiRequestComponent make 3 consecutive requests, 100ms apart.
2. Each request should have an HTTP header `X-Request-Type` with value 'A', 'B', and 'C', in order.
3. The API makes requests of type A wait a bit to simulate some computation.
4. Modify the backend to guarantee that request A gets counter 1 in spite of the delay; B gets 2 and C gets 3. Keep it simple.
5. Show a spinner ("loading indicator") in the frontend while the 3 requests are pending. When all are complete, show the results.
Think _promises/observables_, not a counter like `pending--` ;)
6. Show 3 boxes with the value obtained by request A, B and C in order.
It should be 1-2-3 on the first execution, 4-5-6 on the second, etc.
7. Add a refresh button so you can trigger the 3 requests again instead of reloading the page.
8. Add a milliseconds timer that increases while the spinner is showing (maybe 3-5ms step?),
and stays fixed after that to show how long it took to get the 3 results.
9. Make the component a little nice showing off your mad CSS skills =)
