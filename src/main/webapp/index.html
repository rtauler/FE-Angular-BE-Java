    <h1>Tasks</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Make the multiRequestComponent make 3 consecutive requests, 100ms apart.</li>
        <li>2. Each request should have an HTTP header `X-Request-Type` with value 'A', 'B', and 'C', in order.</li>
        <li>3. The API makes requests of type A wait a bit to simulate some computation.</li>
        <li>4. Modify the backend to guarantee that request A gets counter 1 in spite of the delay; B gets 2 and C gets 3. Keep it simple.</li>
        <li>5. Show a spinner ("loading indicator") in the frontend while the 3 requests are pending. When all are complete, show the results.        Think _promises/observables_, not a counter like `pending--` ;)</li>
        <li>6. Show 3 boxes with the value obtained by request A, B and C in order.        It should be 1-2-3 on the first execution, 4-5-6 on the second, etc.</li>
        <li>7. Add a refresh button so you can trigger the 3 requests again instead of reloading the page.</li>
        <li>8. Add a milliseconds timer that increases while the spinner is showing (maybe 3-5ms step?), and stays fixed after that to show how long it took to get the 3 results.</li>
        <li>9. Make the component a little nice showing off your mad CSS skills =)</li>
    </ul>
